    """
    Compute Money Pump Index for the consumer data.

    The MPI measures the percentage of total expenditure that could be
    "pumped" from a consumer exhibiting cyclic preferences by an arbitrager.

    For a violation cycle k1 -> k2 -> ... -> kn -> k1:

        MPI = sum(p_ki @ x_ki - p_ki @ x_{ki+1}) / sum(p_ki @ x_ki)

    This represents the fraction of expenditure that is "wasted" due to
    inconsistent choices - money that could be extracted by a clever
    arbitrager exploiting the consumer's cyclic preferences.

    Interpretation:
    - MPI = 0.0: Consistent behavior (no money can be pumped)
    - MPI = 0.10: 10% of budget could be extracted
    - MPI = 1.0: Complete irrational behavior (theoretical maximum)
